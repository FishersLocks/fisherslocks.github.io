Fisher's Locks Website
This project is straight forward. It will be a website for the locksmithing business Fisher's Locks.
There is no intention to edit the website once it is published.
This project has no other use besides getting a small business onto the internet.
The basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts used to create the website will be up for grabs to use to create your own similar website.
The likelyhood of responding to any requests for help with this project is low. Most code on here was learned using YouTube videos.
