      <h2>Reasons to Schedule a Door Lock Replacement</h2>
      <p>
        Replacing locks can feel like a hassle, but security is essential for
        your home, family, and belongings. Here are 10 reasons why you should
        consider scheduling a lock replacement.
      </p>

      <h3>Moving Into a New Home</h3>
      <p>
        When moving into a new home most locksmiths highly recommend changing
        all locks on the property, mainly because you do not know who has or
        does not have a key to those locks. The previous owners may have said
        they lost the key for a door when in reality they may have that key and
        will use it to later sneak into the property without your knowledge.
      </p>

      <h3>Home Break-Ins</h3>
      <p>
        If you had any kind of break in on your property that involves the locks
        being damaged, removed, destroyed or otherwise tampered with it is
        extremely recommended that the locks on the property are replaced for
        the safety of your family, and your property, and yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>Lost or Stolen Keys</h3>
      <p>
        Losing the keys to your locks can be stressful and can impact the
        security of what it being protected by those locks. If you lost any of
        the keys to your lock you should have it rekeyed or replaced to prevent
        someone accessing unwanted locations. If your keys are confirmed stolen
        and you have not had anything stolen off your property you still have
        time to get the locks rekeyed or replaced to prevent future theft
        attempts.
      </p>

      <h3>Completed Renovations</h3>
      <p>
        Contractors will often have contractor locks that they will use to keep
        a jobsite secure while they work on a project. Once the job is done
        professionals will replace the contractor locks with end user locks and
        give the keys to the lock to the property owner. Unfortunately we do not
        know who has a copy of the keys to the locks installed by a contractor
        so it is generally recommended that you rekey the lock that was
        installed to prevent a copy from being used resulting in theft.
      </p>

      <h3>Poor Quality Locks</h3>
      <p>
        Not all locks are created equal. Some locks are just better than others.
        Poor quality locks are usually cheaper and easier to get into. Changing
        your locks to higher quality locks will give you peace of mind and
        higher quality security for your family, and your property, and
        yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>Wear and Tear</h3>
      <p>
        Locks wear down over time, though some can last decades with minimal
        use. Most, however, have a lifespan of about seven years. Locksmith
        experts recommend replacing them to maintain security, eliminate
        unwanted key copies, and ensure only authorized access to your property.
      </p>

      <h3>Ending a Rental or Roommate Contract</h3>
      <p>
        The end of a rental or roommate contract should go smoothly but there
        are some cases where the previous renter or roommate is not quite
        finished with the property even though you may be finished with them.
        Replacing the locks will ensure that any disgruntled renter or roommate
        can not come back and take items off the property they are not
        authorized to or squat in a property they no longer pay for. Replacing
        the locks also ensures that any keys that were copied and given to
        friends and family of the renter or roommate are no longer functional in
        the locks on the property.
      </p>

      <h3>Breakups or Divorce</h3>
      <p>
        Nobody wants to think about this happening but lets face it, it happens.
        Replacing the locks ensures an ex can't take what isn't theirs or enter
        without permission, keeping your property secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Life Events and Disabilities</h3>
      <p>
        One of the worst things to happen is an accident or disease that causes
        a person to need to change their entire life in order to make things
        easier for them to access things. If the worst happens to you or a
        family member you may need to change the locks in the house. There are a
        multitude of different locks and door handles that exist to make life
        easier for people with disabilities, caretakers and family members.
      </p>

      <h3>Changing Home Style</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes people need a change in life. Maybe that brass knob doesn't
        match the new stainless steel refrigerator. or the silver door handle
        doesn't match the new brass knocker you just put on. Whatever the case
        may be, there are thousands of different locks and handles to choose
        from to match up with whatever style you choose for your home.
